## `paketobuildpacks/builder:base`

This builder uses the [Paketo Base
Stack](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/base-stack-release) (an Ubuntu
bionic base image) with buildpacks for Java, .NET Core, NodeJS, Go, Python,
Ruby, NGINX, and Procfile.

To see which versions of build and run images, buildpacks, and the lifecycle
that are contained within a given builder version, see the
[Releases](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/base-builder/releases) on this
repo. This information is also available in the `builder.toml`.

For more information about this builder and how to use it, visit the [Paketo
builder documentation](https://paketo.io/docs/builders/).  To learn about the
stack included in this builder, visit the [Paketo stack
